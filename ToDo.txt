it would be convenient to create a more general script where 
1) the slurm version is automatically downloaded 
wget https://download.schedmd.com/slurm/slurm-17.**.*.tar.bz2
2) export and variable VER so that you don't need to change manually all the versions of slurm package. 
like for example is done in 
export VER=17.11.7
yum install slurm-$VER*rpm slurm-devel-$VER*rpm slurm-perlapi-$VER*rpm slurm-torque-$VER*rpm slurm-example-configs-$VER*rpm
